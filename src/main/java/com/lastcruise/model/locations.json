As you stroll along, you can feel the soft smooth green sand under your feet. The sand is very hot and walking through it feels like you are walking on a burning grill. You must brave the conditions, gather your items here, and build a raft. ",

A river flows through its middle and the sound of birds perching on a lake nearby can be heard if one listens carefully. Hidden in the northern part of the jungle is a rope that can come in handy.

Pieces of metal are scattered around; an old machete and several steel pipes can be seen a few meters from the entrance. An object that appears to be the size of a needle can be seen at the bottom of the shaft. As you descend to the bottom of the shaft, the object turns out to be a flashlight. ",
